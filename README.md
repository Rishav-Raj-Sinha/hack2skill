# Crime Prediction and Monitoring System

Welcome to the Crime Prediction and Monitoring System! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical crime data, predict future crime rates, identify crime-prone areas, and determine the most common types of crimes. The system is built using Python and leverages various libraries such as Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy, Plotly, and Prophet for data analysis, modeling, visualization, and forecasting.

Features:

  Data Collection and Preprocessing: The system gathers historical crime data from various sources and preprocesses it using Pandas for cleaning, formatting, and organizing the data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

  Machine Learning Models: Several machine learning models are implemented to analyze the crime data and make predictions. These models include but are not limited to:
        - Regression models for predicting crime rates.
        - Classification models for identifying crime-prone areas.
        - Time-series forecasting models for predicting future crime trends.
        - Clustering algorithms for identifying patterns in crime data.

  Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, and other visualization libraries are used to create interactive plots, graphs, and maps to visualize the crime data, trends, and patterns. This helps in understanding the data better and communicating insights effectively.

  Streamlit Application: The predictive models and visualizations are integrated into a Streamlit application for easy access and interaction. Users can input parameters, view predictions, explore visualizations, and analyze crime data through an intuitive web interface
